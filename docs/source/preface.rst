Preface
========

In the post-AlphaFolD2 era, more and more articles and ideas have been put forward. On the one hand, it is difficult for us to have enough 
energy to follow all the articles; on the other hand, the conclusions of many articles lack sufficient ablation experiments and empirical analysis 
to support their conclusions. This article will propose a Roadmap for BioAI and hopefully generate sufficient community discussion.
